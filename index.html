        <h1>Hey Spamudi...</h1>
        <p> I still remember the first day we met, It was a simple introduction, but our eyes met and the sparks flew. That eye contact we made at Katraj Chowk, wow, unbelievable! It was a close call. </p>
        <p> And then your smile hit me like a brick wall! It's been almost 1 year now since we met, and I still remember that touch under the table at our first dinner while traveling to Pune. </p>
        <p> I still remember the fun we had in my car while traveling. I still remember my favorite song which you played, and that was already my favorite! I donâ€™t know how we were so close to sitting together there... </p>
        <p> I donâ€™t need a thousand reasons to love you; I just need one... and that's you. </p>
        <h2>Happy Propose Day Spamudi! I love you so much! ðŸ’–</h2>
